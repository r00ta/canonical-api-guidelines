# Canonical REST API Guidelines

This repository contains the Canonical REST API Guidelines. 

- [REST API Guidelines](Guidelines.md)

## Why do we need guidelines?
Think about a customer or a community user that wants to consume multiple services or products of an organization. Wouldn't it be nice to have common patterns/styles across the services and products? That way, the user can focus on the core business logic of your product, not on your API flavours.  

We believe these guidelines are important also if your API are internal: some of the points were learned the hard way over the years, and our goal is to prevent you to experience the same again. 

## What are the guidelines?
API design is sometimes an art and there are multiple ways to achieve the same thing. These guidelines do not aim to be the ultimate solution, but rather to 
- establish a set of principles for good API desing
- provide a set of directives to ensure consistency across Canonical's products and services. 

## How did you come up with the guidelines?
We understand you might have different preferences regarding some of the points, for example you might prefer to use [camelCasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for your JSON keys and there is nothing really wrong with it, but we believe that consistency across the products is more important than an opinionated personal preference. 

In order to craft these guidelines
- we used our experience on the products we built over the last +10 years
- we looked at the best practices of other companies and organizations

## The spirit of these guidelines

This is a living document and additions are not only expected but required. We encourage you to contribute. API design was different 10 years ago and it will be different in 10 years from now: it is never going to be complete.
